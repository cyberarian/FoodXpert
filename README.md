XpertChat
=========
As a librarian with a keen interest in intersecting disciplines, I have developed a chatbot app powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Groq. This app is designed to represent four key domains: Computer Science, Library and Information Science, Archival Studies, and Data Science. My goal is to provide students and the general public with a tool that enhances their understanding and knowledge across these fields.

**XpertChat** is a Streamlit-based application designed to facilitate expert consultations through a chat interface. Whether you're seeking advice on a specific topic or want to connect with professionals in various fields, XpertChat offers a user-friendly platform to get expert opinions quickly and efficiently. The app leverages AI to streamline the consultation process, ensuring that users receive accurate and helpful insights.
